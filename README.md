https://travis-ci.org/noahmvf/10-stacks-queues

Enqueue
- We remove the last item from our queue and return its value, same as the push() method

Dequeue
- We take out the first item in our queue and return its value, same as the pop() method

Peek
- We are looking at (returning) the starting value of the list

isEmpty
- We check to see if our queue is empty



Add your Travis badge to the top of your README. List out the methods for your Queue and Stack class and explain what they do by using your favorite analogy for each. List the Big Oh time and space complexity for each method, making considerations for the actual Big Oh complexity they might have under the hood when utilizing Linked List or Array methods.
